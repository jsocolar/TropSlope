# TropSlope
Tropslope_ecoregion.txt is GEE code pasted over from the editor.  It computes means and histograms of slopes by tropical deforestation category for each continent.  These are exported to Google Drive, and have been saved in /Dropbox/Work/Tropical_steepness/GEE_output_data/ under the filenames:

Africa_slope_2000_hist.csv
Africa_slope_2000.csv
Africa_slope_GL_hist.csv
Africa_slope_GL.csv
Americas_slope_2000_hist.csv
Americas_slope_2000.csv
Americas_slope_GL_hist.csv
Americas_slope_GL.csv
AsiaOceania_slope_2000_hist.csv
AsiaOceania_slope_2000.csv
AsiaOceania_slope_GL_hist.csv
AsiaOceania_slope_GL.csv

Note that Asia and Oceania are lumped. This region includes New Guinea but not mainland Australia.  Functionally, this lumping is because the relevant dataset includes Irian Jaya in SE Asia, and there’s no good way to split Indonesia.  But I think it’s overall reasonable in terms of the likely deforestation pressures in different parts of the world.  If necessary, we can split Asia and Oceania at Wallace’s line in the future.
